# Round 8: regression coverage for the v0.6.0 audit fixes —
#   - base64 newline strip (would silently break signing on macOS)
#   - fm_field prefix collision (`from` no longer matches `from_name`)
#   - canonical NUL separation (newlines in fields can't collide canonicals)
#   - @-mention regex escape (names with `.` no longer wildcard-match)
#   - TOCTOU between validate and render (file content captured once)
#   - per-bus require_signatures policy
#   - watcher start mkdir-lock (concurrent starts serialise)
