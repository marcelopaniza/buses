# --from-stdin mode: the /buses:send slash command pipes $ARGUMENTS via a
# heredoc with a single-quoted delimiter, so the host shell does NOT expand
# $(...) or backticks inside the user's message body. We parse the payload
# here, where no further bash evaluation can occur, then fall through to the
# regular flow with bus/to/body set as positional args.
#
# Why this matters: the previous slash-command shape was
#   "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/send.sh" "$ARGUMENTS"
# Claude Code substitutes $ARGUMENTS into the .md template BEFORE bash
# parses it, so the resulting bash source had the body sitting inside
# double quotes — where command substitution and backticks still fire. A
# body like `hi $(touch /tmp/x)` therefore executed the touch on the
# SENDER's machine while the message was being sent. See tests/round-10.sh.
