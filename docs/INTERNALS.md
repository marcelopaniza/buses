# Internals

Wire format, directory layout, concurrency model, and the design choice behind polling-instead-of-inotify. Read this if you're contributing, debugging, or implementing a compatible client.

## Message format

YAML frontmatter + body, separated by `---` lines:

```
---
id: 8b357bc5-429c-4c69-9b1b-b34d62de2bd5
bus: general
from: b06cbb43-d7ae-4ae2-83d6-557edb07145e
from_name: alice
to: bob,felix          # or "all", a name, a UUID, or a comma-list
to_id: 924257ec-…      # optional, for single recipient
ts: 2026-05-17T02:44:09Z
sig: Bo6QKEy…==        # Ed25519 signature, base64 of raw bytes
                       # (required when sender has published a public_key)
---
hey bob and felix — can we sync on the deploy? @bob has the logs.
```

Filenames: `<UTC-compact-timestamp>__<short-id>.msg` — sortable, unique. The latest-by-mtime (not latest-by-filename) determines cursor advance, since two messages sent in the same second tie on the second-resolution prefix.

## Concurrency notes

- **Atomic writes**: write to `<dir>/.<file>.tmp.$$`, then `mv` into place. The `mv` is atomic on every POSIX filesystem (including NFS — the rename RPC is atomic).
- **Cursors live per-session** in `$BUSES_CONFIG_DIR/state/<sid>/` — never on the share. Two terminals can have completely different read positions without colliding.
- The watcher uses a **separate notify cursor** so notifications and Claude-delivery are independent. When the hook delivers a message, both cursors advance (so the watcher won't re-ping for something Claude already saw).
- **Hook never blocks the prompt** (5s timeout, always exits 0). A misconfigured hook can't take down your session.
- **Single-instance daemons** (watcher, `buses-react`) use mkdir-based lockdirs. `mkdir` is atomic on POSIX filesystems, so the lock-acquire is race-free without needing `flock` (which isn't portable across macOS/Linux/BSD).

## Why polling, not inotify?

inotify/fswatch only see writes from the local kernel. On NFS / Syncthing / Dropbox / iCloud they miss writes from other machines — the file appears on disk via the sync daemon, not via a local `write(2)` syscall, so no inotify event fires.

Polling works everywhere; cost is one `find -newer cursor` per interval per subscribed bus — negligible. On tmpfs/SSD the `find` returns in microseconds, and the `-newer` predicate uses the kernel's stat cache, so even on a folder with thousands of message files, the check is sub-millisecond.

The trade-off is latency: with the default 5s watcher interval, you might wait up to 5s for a desktop notification. The Claude Code hook has no latency because it fires on every prompt submission — messages reach the model the instant you type into a window.
