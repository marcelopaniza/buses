# UserPromptSubmit hook: pull any unread messages addressed to this session,
# inject them as additionalContext, and advance the cursor. Silent on error,
# silent when there is nothing to deliver — so cost is ~0 tokens in the idle
# case and never blocks the user's prompt.
#
# Fast path: when nothing has changed since the last hook fire (config file
# unmodified AND every subscribed bus's messages/ dir has the same mtime as
# last time AND the cached bus list matches the live config), skip the full
# check.sh entirely. A cached fingerprint lives at
# $BUSES_CONFIG_DIR/state/hook-mtime-stash.
#
# Security model. The stash is trust-but-verify cache: a same-UID peer who
# can write to $BUSES_CONFIG_DIR is hostile by design (see threat model).
# Two hardening measures:
#   (1) per-process tmp via mktemp on the slow-path stash refresh — prevents
#       a peer from planting a fixed-name `.tmp` symlink that would redirect
#       our write to an attacker-chosen victim file.
#   (2) the fast path cross-checks the cached bus list against `jq .buses`
#       from the live config — without this, a peer who forges a stash with
#       only a subset of buses (or none at all) can silently censor messages
#       on the omitted buses until the victim happens to modify config.
#
# Stash format (one key=value per line):
#   cfg=<config_mtime>
#   shared=<shared_path>
#   b=<bus_name>=<messages_dir_mtime>
#   ...
#
# Worst case under stale / forged stash: one redundant slow-path run. Any
# unexpected condition falls through to the full check.sh path; nothing is
# silently dropped.
